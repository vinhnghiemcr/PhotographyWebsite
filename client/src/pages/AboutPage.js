            <h3>My Story</h3>
            <p>Howdy!</p>
            <p>I’m a San Antonio, Texas-based wedding & portrait photographer, a storyteller, a believer in working hard with a heart for adventure and a wife to my best friend, John, and a mother to my three wonderful kids. I'm a down to earth, straight forward person who likes to make her own offbeat path in life.</p>
            <p>With a degree in Visual Communications, it came as no surprise to me that I would have an eye for photography, it was finally having my first child that gave me the confidence to finally do something with my talent...</p>
            <p>My photographic journey started in 2002 when my first daughter was born, and I purchased my first digital camera. I wanted to make sure that I captured every little moment of my child's life. While enjoying every second with my newborn baby, I quickly realized my natural talent and passion for photography and felt like I had finally found my true calling in life.</p>
            <p>Bluefire Photography is in its 10th year of business and has always operated as a small, exclusive studio that does not measure success in numbers but rather the personal and overall experience. Theodore Roosevelt once said, “Far and away the best prize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at a work worth doing.” By documenting Stories, I live that statement.</p>
            <p>I'm so glad you're here and thrilled that you are considering Bluefire Photography to be a part of this special time in your lives…… let’s capture your story.</p>
